It may be difficult or impossible to update legacy applications or existing code libraries to add these features, because the code is no longer maintained or can&amp;rsquo;t be easily modified by the development team.
Network calls also require substantial configuration for connection, authentication, and authorization. If these calls are used across multiple applications, built using multiple languages and frameworks, the calls must be configured for each of these instances.</description></item></channel></rss>
