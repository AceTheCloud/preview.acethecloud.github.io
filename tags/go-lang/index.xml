In Go (also known as Golang), functional programming can be achieved using first-class functions, anonymous functions, and higher-order functions.
Golang is a multi-paradigm programming language. As a Golang programmer why uses functional programming? Golang is not a functional language but has a lot of features that enable us to applies functional principles in the development, turning our code more elegant, concise, maintainable, easier to understand and test.</description></item><item><title>Maximizing Performance with Concurrency in Go üë®üèº‚Äçüíª</title><link>https://AceTheOps.com/blog/concurrency-in-golang/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Dec 2022 22:18:07 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://AceTheOps.com/blog/concurrency-in-golang/</guid><description>Golang, or Go, is a programming language that is known for its simplicity, concurrency support, and efficient memory management. Concurrency in Go allows developers to write programs that can perform multiple tasks concurrently, allowing for faster and more efficient execution. In this blog post, we will explore the basics of concurrency in Go and provide some code examples to help you get started.
To begin, let&amp;rsquo;s define what we mean by concurrency.</description></item><item><title>Going deeper with Go sockets: Advanced concepts and techniques ü´°</title><link>https://AceTheOps.com/blog/golang-socket-programming-concepts/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Dec 2022 00:18:07 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://AceTheOps.com/blog/golang-socket-programming-concepts/</guid><description>Welcome to this tutorial on advanced techniques for socket programming in Go!
