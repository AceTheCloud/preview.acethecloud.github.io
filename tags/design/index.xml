It is a shared digital space 💻 where people 🙍‍♂️🙍‍♀️ can interact with each other 🤝 and with virtual objects 💎 and environments 🌲 in real-time.
Metaverses 🌌 have been around for decades, but recent advances in technology 🤖 have made it possible for developers 💻 to create more immersive and interactive experiences.</description></item><item><title>Amabassador Pattern</title><link>https://preview.acethecloud.com/blog/amabassador-pattern/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Dec 2022 17:38:27 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://preview.acethecloud.com/blog/amabassador-pattern/</guid><description>Resilient cloud-based applications require features such as circuit breaking, routing, metering and monitoring, and the ability to make network-related configuration updates. It may be difficult or impossible to update legacy applications or existing code libraries to add these features, because the code is no longer maintained or can&amp;rsquo;t be easily modified by the development team.
Network calls also require substantial configuration for connection, authentication, and authorization. If these calls are used across multiple applications, built using multiple languages and frameworks, the calls must be configured for each of these instances.</description></item></channel></rss>
