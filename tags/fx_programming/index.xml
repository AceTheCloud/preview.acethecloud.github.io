In Go (also known as Golang), functional programming can be achieved using first-class functions, anonymous functions, and higher-order functions.
Golang is a multi-paradigm programming language. As a Golang programmer why uses functional programming? Golang is not a functional language but has a lot of features that enable us to applies functional principles in the development, turning our code more elegant, concise, maintainable, easier to understand and test.</description></item></channel></rss>
