It enables users to quickly and easily deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications on Azure.
Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that allows developers to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It uses a declarative configuration to define the desired state of an application and continuously works to maintain that state.
With AKS, users can leverage the power of Kubernetes without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure.</description></item><item><title>Best practices for securing your Azure Kubernetes Service deployment</title><link>https://preview.acethecloud.com/blog/securing-azure-kubernetes/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Dec 2022 00:38:27 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://preview.acethecloud.com/blog/securing-azure-kubernetes/</guid><description>Securing your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) deployment is crucial to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your applications and data. In this blog post, we will explore some best practices for securing your AKS deployment.
1. Use Azure AD for authentication and authorization . Azure AD provides centralized identity and access management for your AKS cluster. You can use Azure AD to authenticate users and grant them access to the cluster and its resources.</description></item><item><title>Amabassador Pattern</title><link>https://preview.acethecloud.com/blog/amabassador-pattern/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Dec 2022 17:38:27 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://preview.acethecloud.com/blog/amabassador-pattern/</guid><description>Resilient cloud-based applications require features such as circuit breaking, routing, metering and monitoring, and the ability to make network-related configuration updates. It may be difficult or impossible to update legacy applications or existing code libraries to add these features, because the code is no longer maintained or can&amp;rsquo;t be easily modified by the development team.
Network calls also require substantial configuration for connection, authentication, and authorization. If these calls are used across multiple applications, built using multiple languages and frameworks, the calls must be configured for each of these instances.</description></item></channel></rss>
