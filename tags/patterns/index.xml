In Go (also known as Golang), functional programming can be achieved using first-class functions, anonymous functions, and higher-order functions.
Golang is a multi-paradigm programming language. As a Golang programmer why uses functional programming? Golang is not a functional language but has a lot of features that enable us to applies functional principles in the development, turning our code more elegant, concise, maintainable, easier to understand and test.</description></item><item><title>Amabassador Pattern</title><link>https://preview.acethecloud.com/blog/amabassador-pattern/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Dec 2022 17:38:27 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://preview.acethecloud.com/blog/amabassador-pattern/</guid><description>Resilient cloud-based applications require features such as circuit breaking, routing, metering and monitoring, and the ability to make network-related configuration updates. It may be difficult or impossible to update legacy applications or existing code libraries to add these features, because the code is no longer maintained or can&amp;rsquo;t be easily modified by the development team.
Network calls also require substantial configuration for connection, authentication, and authorization. If these calls are used across multiple applications, built using multiple languages and frameworks, the calls must be configured for each of these instances.</description></item></channel></rss>
